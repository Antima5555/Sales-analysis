📊 USA Regional Sales Analysis

A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project exploring Acme Co.'s USA sales data (2014–2018) to uncover regional performance trends, product insights, and strategic opportunities.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Sales teams lack data-driven insights into regional trends, seasonal impacts, and channel profitability. This project aims to uncover performance patterns, inform strategic planning, and drive data-backed decisions.

## 🛠️ Approach

- **Phase 1 – EDA**  
  Cleaned, joined, and analyzed multi-table sales data (products, customers, budgets, geography).  
  Uncovered trends using aggregation, visualization & correlation analysis.

- **Phase 2 – Interactive Dashboard**  
  Built a Power BI dashboard for self-serve insights on revenue, customers, regions, and time.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- ~18,000+ rows of transactional data  
- Key fields: product, customer, revenue, cost, margin, region, date, and channel  
- Cleaned and normalized: No missing or duplicate data

## 📈 Key Insights

- Revenue dips in Jan/Apr; peaks in May/Jun  
- Products 25 & 26 drive ~25% of total sales  
- Wholesale accounts for 54% of sales; Export has highest margins (~38%)  
- California leads in revenue and order volume  
- Top 10 customers contribute a disproportionate share of revenue

## ✅ Recommendations

- Run seasonal campaigns in Jan/Apr to smooth revenue dips  
- Double down on top SKUs and reprice or phase out low-margin products  
- Expand export efforts and optimize wholesale pricing  
- Replicate California's success across lower-performing regions  
- Use dashboards to monitor low-margin orders in real time
